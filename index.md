## About Me

Hi! My name is Minhak Song, and I am an undergraduate student at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/), majoring in Mathematical Sciences (minor in Industrial and Systems Engineering). My research interests center on the foundations of modern machine learning, spanning the theory of deep learning, language models, generative models, and interactive decision making, with the goal of bridging theory and practice. 

I have recently been studying the training dynamics of optimization algorithms in deep learning, advised by [Prof. Chulhee Yun](https://chulheeyun.github.io) at KAIST AI and closely collaborating with [Kwangjun Ahn](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kwangjunahn/) at Microsoft Research. I was also a visiting student researcher at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), hosted by [Prof. Simon Shaolei Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/), where I worked on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) from an optimization perspective. Starting this summer, I am working with [Prof. Sewoong Oh](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sewoong/) at the University of Washington on zeroth-order optimization.

I’m always happy to discuss research and potential collaborations. Feel free to reach out!

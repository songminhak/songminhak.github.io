## About Me

I am an undergraduate student at KAIST. I am interested in building the theoretical foundations of machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning through the lens of optimization theory and statistics.

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning Theory**
- **Optimization**
- **Statistics**

## News

- **[Jan. 2024]** Our paper on the optimization characteristics of linear Transformers is accepted to ICLR 2024.
- **[Oct. 2023]** Our paper on the optimization characteristics of linear Transformers is accepted to NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Mathematics of Modern Machine Learning (M3L) as an **oral presentation**.
- **[Sep. 2023]** Our paper on understanding the Edge of Stability in deep learning is accepted to NeurIPS 2023.

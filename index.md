## About Me

Hi! I am an undergraduate student at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/), double majoring in Industrial & Systems Engineering and Mathematical Sciences. My research interest lies in building the theoretical foundations of modern machine learning through the lens of optimization theory and statistics. Recently, I am focusing on understanding the training dynamics of gradient-based optimization methods in deep learning, closely working with [Prof. Chulhee Yun](https://chulheeyun.github.io).

I am on leave of absence from my studies at KAIST to fulfill my mandatory military service in South Korea, from February 2023 to November 2024.

## About Me

Hi! My name is Minhak Song, and I am an undergraduate student at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/), majoring in Mathematical Sciences (minor in Industrial and Systems Engineering). My research interests center on the theoretical foundations of modern machine learning, with the goal of bridging theory and practice. 

I have recently been studying the training dynamics of optimization algorithms in deep learning, advised by [Prof. Chulhee Yun](https://chulheeyun.github.io). I was also a visiting student at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), hosted by [Prof. Simon Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/), where I worked on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) from an optimization perspective. This summer, I am working with [Prof. Sewoong Oh](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sewoong/) at UW on zeroth-order optimization.

Iâ€™m always open to conversations and potential collaborations. Feel free to reach out!
